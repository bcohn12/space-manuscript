@article{Bartel1986effect,
	Abstract = {Debris resulting from damage to the surface of polyethylene components
	of total joint replacements has previously been shown to contribute
	to long-term problems such as loosening and infection. Surface damage
	has been associated with fatigue processes due to stresses arising
	from contact between the metal and polyethylene components in these
	prostheses. In the present study, we used elasticity and finite-element
	solutions to determine these stresses for total hip replacements
	with head diameters of twenty-two and twenty-eight millimeters and
	for a condylar total knee replacement. We also examined the effect
	on these stresses of using carbon-fiber-reinforced polyethylene instead
	of plain polyethylene. Stresses associated with surface damage in
	the tibial component of the total knee replacement were much larger
	than those in the hip replacements. The analysis of contact stress
	as a function of thickness of the polyethylene insert for tibial
	components showed that a thickness of more than eight to ten millimeters
	should be maintained when possible. The contact stress in the tibial
	components was reduced most when the articulating surfaces were more
	conforming in the medial-lateral direction. Contact stresses were
	much less sensitive to changes in geometry in the anterior-posterior
	direction. For the hip components, the stresses were lower in the
	acetabular component of the twenty-eight-millimeter hip replacement
	than in the twenty-two-millimeter replacement. The use of carbon-fiber-reinforced
	polyethylene resulted in stresses that were higher by as much as
	40 per cent. Because the contact area between articulating surfaces
	moves during flexion, portions of the surface will be subjected to
	cyclic stresses. The contact area for the knee replacements in flexion
	was smaller than for the hip replacements, and the range of the maximum
	principal stress was larger. Consequently, the combination of the
	higher stress and the moving contact area is more likely to cause
	surface damage due to fatigue in tibial components than in acetabular
	components, which is consistent with clinical observations.},

	and convenient environment for the design and evaluation of controllers
	for functional electrical stimulation (FES) prior to clinical trials.
	We have developed a set of integrated musculoskeletal modeling tools
	to facilitate the model building process. Simulink models of musculoskeletal
	systems are created using two software packages developed in our
	laboratory, Musculoskeletal Modeling in Simulink (MMS) and virtual
	muscle, in addition to one software package available commercially,
	SIMM (Musculographics Inc., USA). MMS converts anatomically accurate
	musculoskeletal models generated by SIMM into Simulink(R) blocks.
	It also removes run-time constraints on kinetic simulations in SIMM,
	and allows the development of complex musculoskeletal models without
	writing a line of code. Virtual muscle builds realistic Simulink
	models of muscles responding to either natural recruitment or FES.
	Models of sensorimotor control systems can be developed using various
	Matlab (Mathworks Inc., USA) toolboxes and integrated easily with
	these musculoskeletal blocks in the graphical environment of Simulink.},

	the function of each muscle can be analyzed by computing its length,

	from any perspective and graphically manipulate the joint kinematics

@article{Kuo1993Human,
	Abstract = {We developed a theoretical framework for studying coordination strategies
	in standing posture. The framework consists of a musculoskeletal
	model of the human lower extremity in the sagittal plane and a technique
	to visualize, geometrically, how constraints internal and external
	to the body affect movement. The set of all feasible accelerations
	(i.e., the "feasible acceleration set" or FAS) that muscles can induce
	at positions near upright were calculated. We found that musculoskeletal
	mechanics dictate that independent control of joints is relatively
	difficult to achieve. When muscle activations are constrained so
	the knees stay straight, to approximate the typical postural response
	to perturbation, the corresponding subset of the feasible acceleration
	set greatly favors a combination of ankle and hip movement in the
	ratio 1:3 (called the "hip strategy"). Independent control of these
	two joints remains difficult to achieve. When near the boundary of
	instability, the orientation and shape of this subset show that the
	movement strategy necessary to maintain stability, without taking
	a step, is quite restricted. Hypothesizing that regulation of center-of-mass
	position is crucial to maintaining balance, we examined the feasible
	set of center-of-mass accelerations. When the knees must be kept
	straight, the acceleration of the center of mass is severely limited
	vertically, but not horizontally. We also found that the "ankle strategy",
	involving rotation about the ankles only, requires more muscle activation
	than the "hip strategy" for a given amount of horizontal acceleration.
	Our model therefore predicts that the hip strategy is most effective
	at controlling the center of mass with minimal muscle activation
	("neural effort").},

@article{Pandy1990optimal,
	Abstract = {To understand how intermuscular control, inertial interactions among
	body segments, and musculotendon dynamics coordinate human movement,
	we have chosen to study maximum-height jumping. Because this activity
	presents a relatively unambiguous performance criterion, it fits
	well into the framework of optimal control theory. The human body
	is modeled as a four-segment, planar, articulated linkage, with adjacent
	links joined together by frictionless revolutes. Driving the skeletal
	system are eight musculotendon actuators, each muscle modeled as
	a three-element, lumped-parameter entity, in series with tendon.
	Tendon is assumed to be elastic, and its properties are defined by
	a stress-strain curve. The mechanical behavior of muscle is described
	by a Hill-type contractile element, including both series and parallel
	elasticity. Driving the musculotendon model is a first-order representation
	of excitation-contraction (activation) dynamics. The optimal control
	problem is to maximize the height reached by the center of mass of
	the body subject to body-segmental, musculotendon, and activation
	dynamics, a zero vertical ground reaction force at lift-off, and
	constraints which limit the magnitude of the incoming neural control
	signals to lie between zero (no excitation) and one (full excitation).
	A computational solution to this problem was found on the basis of
	a Mayne-Polak dynamic optimization algorithm. Qualitative comparisons
	between the predictions of the model and previously reported experimental
	findings indicate that the model reproduces the major features of
	a maximum-height squat jump (i.e. limb-segmental angular displacements,
	vertical and horizontal ground reaction forces, sequence of muscular
	activity, overall jump height, and final lift-off time).},

@article{Prilutsky2000Muscle,
	Abstract = {In this response, the major criticisms of the target article are addressed.
	Terminology from the target article that may have caused some confusion
	is clarified. In particular, the tasks that have the basic features
	of muscle coordination, as identified in the target article, have
	been limited in scope. A new metabolic optimization criterion suggested
	by Alexander (2000) is examined for its ability to predict muscle
	coordination in walking. Issues concerning the validation of muscle
	force predictions, the rules of muscle coordination, and the role
	of directional constraints in coordination of two-joint muscles are
	discussed. It is shown in particular that even in one-joint systems,
	the forces predicted by the criterion of Crowninshield and Brand
	(1981) depend upon the muscle moment arms and the physiological cross-sectional
	areas in much more complex ways than either previously assumed in
	the target article, or incorrectly derived by Herzog and Ait-Haddou
	(2000). It is concluded that the criterion of Crowninshield and Brand
	qualitatively predicts the basic coordination features of the major
	one- and two-joint muscles in a number of highly skilled, repetitive
	motor tasks performed by humans under predictable conditions and
	little demands on stability and accuracy. A possible functional significance
	of such muscle coordination may be the minimization of perceived
	effort, muscle fatigue, and/or energy expenditure.},

@article{Rawlinson2002Flat,
	Abstract = {The potential for wear in UHMWPE components for total knee replacements
	can be reduced by decreasing the stresses and strains arising from
	tibial-femoral contact. The conformity of the articular surfaces
	has a large effect on the resultant stresses, and components that
	achieve flat medial-lateral contact have been assumed to produce
	the lowest stresses due to their perfect conformity. We computed
	the stresses arising from curved and flat contact on a half-space
	using two-dimensional, plane strain elasticity solutions and finite
	element analyses to compare the performance of curved and flat indenters.
	These indenters were represented by a polynomial so the profiles
	could be continuously varied from curved to flat. Curved contact
	resulted in maximum stresses at the center of contact, while flat
	contact produced maximum stresses at the edge of contact. In addition,
	three contemporary tibial configurations (flat-on-flat, curved-on-flat,
	and curved-on-curved geometries) were analyzed using the finite element
	method with nonlinear material properties. The maximum contact stress,
	von Mises stress, and von Mises strain were lowest for the curved-on-curved
	model. The other configurations resulted in higher contact stresses,
	von Mises stresses, and von Mises strains. The perfect conformity
	arising from flat contact did not reduce the contact stresses in
	the UHMWPE component. The tensile stresses, however, were lowest
	for the flat-on-flat geometry compared with the other two configurations.
	Relating these distinct differences could prove useful in interpretation
	of data from simulator and retrieval studies.},

@article{Valero-Cuevas2000Scaling,
	Abstract = {Human fingers have sufficiently more muscles than joints such that every fingertip force of submaximal magnitude can be produced by an infinite number of muscle coordination patterns. Nevertheless, the nervous system seems to effortlessly select muscle coordination patterns when sequentially producing fingertip forces of low, moderate, and maximal magnitude. The hypothesis of this study is that the selection of coordination patterns to produce submaximal forces is simplified by the appropriate modulation of the magnitude of a muscle coordination pattern capable of producing the largest expected fingertip force. In each of three directions, eight subjects were asked to sequentially produce fingertip forces of low, moderate, and maximal magnitude with their dominant forefinger. Muscle activity was described by fine-wire electromyograms (EMGs) simultaneously collected from all muscles of the forefinger. A muscle coordination pattern was defined as the vector list of the EMG activity of each muscle. For all force directions, statistically significant muscle coordination patterns similar to those previously reported for 100\% of maximal fingertip forces were found for 50\% of maximal voluntary force. Furthermore the coordination pattern and fingertip force vector magnitudes were highly correlated (r > 0.88). Average coordination pattern vectors at 50 and 100\% of maximal force were highly correlated with each other, as well as with individual coordination pattern vectors in the ramp transitions preceding them. In contrast to this consistency of EMG coordination patterns, predictions using a musculoskeletal computer model of the forefinger show that force magnitudes =50\% of maximal fingertip force can be produced by coordination patterns drastically different from those needed for maximal force. Thus when modulating fingertip force magnitude across the voluntary range, the number of contributing muscles and the relative activity among them was not changed. Rather, the production of low and moderate forces seems to be simplified by appropriately scaling the magnitude of a coordination pattern capable of producing the highest force expected.},
